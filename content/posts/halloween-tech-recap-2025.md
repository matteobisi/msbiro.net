As Halloween approaches and the days grow shorter, it’s the perfect time for a spooky story… or, in my case, a recap of what’s been brewing in my professional life! With the end of the year lurking around the corner, it’s time to take stock of the exciting changes, challenging projects, and community efforts that have made 2025 a year to remember. So, grab your pumpkin-spiced latte, and let’s dive into the cauldron of the last few months.

## One Year at ReeVo: A Bewitching Transition

It’s hard to believe it’s almost been a year since I joined [**ReeVo**](https://www.reevo.it/en/). The transition from a fantastic startup like **SIGHUP** to a larger, more structured company has been a magical experience. One of the most significant changes has been the simplification of my role, thanks to the well-defined Business Units at ReeVo.

Working with specialized teams has made a world of difference. Whether it’s making deals with partners, communicating with customers, or even navigating internal processes, everything is more streamlined. Need a new MacBook for a team member? There’s a process for that. Need a mailbox for my user group? Done! This level of organization has allowed me to focus more on what I do best: leading my team and driving our technical vision forward.

The excitement is also building for our upcoming **Christmas dinner in Milan**, which will be my first visit to the ReeVo headquarters. And if that’s not enough to look forward to, we’re already in the early stages of planning for **KubeCon EU 2026**!

## Technical Treats of 2025

On the technical front, 2025 has been a thrilling ride. We’re continuing to work with cutting-edge technologies and tackle some of the most pressing challenges in cybersecurity. Here are a few highlights:

* **SentinelOne CNAPP**: We’re engaged in an exciting project with SentinelOne’s CNAPP solution, exploring Kubernetes security and posture management. Stay tuned for more updates soon.
* **HashiCorp Vault and Boundary**: We’re expanding our corporate secrets management and Privileged Access Management (PAM) capabilities by adding IBM/HashiCorp Vault and Boundary to our solution portfolio.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Security**: We continue to provide advisory services to several customers on CI/CD pipeline security best practices, helping them operate securely through our proven methodologies and experience developed over the past years.
* **Hardened Images**: There’s no CI/CD security without a strong foundation of reliable hardened image catalogs and MCP servers. We’re actively working on this area; more news will follow soon.

## Community Corner: No Tricks, Just Treats

On the “personal” side, I’m thrilled to be back in the world of event organization. For the past couple of months, I’ve been part of the organizing team for the next [**Cloud Native Days Italy**](https://cloudnativedaysitaly.org/), which will take place in Bologna next May. The preparations are in full swing, and we have some amazing content and announcements coming soon for the 2026 edition.

It feels great to be back in this role after stepping away from my friends at **Let’s Connect** when my job focus changed.

## No Rest for the Wicked… and Loving It!

You might think that with all this going on, I’d be exhausted. And you’d be right! But I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m one of those people who thrives on being busy and is genuinely passionate about what they do.

So, if you see me at the gym after work with my headphones on, I might just be listening to a cloud-native podcast to recharge my batteries. (Just kidding… or am I? 😉)

That’s all for now. I hope you have a spooktacular Halloween and a productive end to the year!
