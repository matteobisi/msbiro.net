The countdown to KubeCon EU (London) has begun, and I couldnâ€™t be more thrilled to announce that, for the third year in a row, Iâ€™ll have the incredible privilege of attending!

This year is extra special because, for the second time, Iâ€™ll be managing a booth alongside my amazing colleagues.  
Why? Because [ReeVo](https://www.reevo.it/en/), the company that SIGHUP has now joined, will proudly be a sponsor of this major event!

Being a sponsor at KubeCon is no small feat. It means rolling up our sleeves for an exciting whirlwind of extra work and packing plenty of throat lozenges to keep my voice intact through all the conversations (and trust me, there will be a lot of them!). Itâ€™s multitasking on steroids, but I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way!  

The real magic of KubeCon lies in the connections. Itâ€™s an unparalleled opportunity to meet and engage with brilliant minds from every corner of the globe. Itâ€™s about putting faces to names and building meaningful relationships with partners, collaborators, and project contributors; people Iâ€™ll be working closely with throughout the year. These moments of connection are what make this event truly unforgettable.

Iâ€™m beyond excited and absolutely energized to dive into this experience once again.

So, see you in London! If youâ€™re attending the conference, donâ€™t miss outâ€”come by our booth and say hi!
