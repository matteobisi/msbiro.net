Yesterday, KubeCon NA in Chicago came to a close, so now we can start looking forward to KubeCon EU 2024,  
which will take place in Paris from March 19th to 22nd, 2024 😊.  

For Paris, [early bird registrations](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/register/) are open until November 28th, and it’s still possible to [submit proposals for the call for papers](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp/).

I wanted to share an interesting initiative called Kubetrain, which aims to help attendees reach Paris in a more environmentally sustainable way by choosing trains over planes.

To make the journey economically sustainable as well, the organizers of Kubetrain have arranged for sponsored carriages from several major European cities.  
This innovative approach not only reduces carbon footprints but also provides opportunities for networking events during the trip!

The cities involved are as follows:

- Amsterdam
- Berlin
- London
- Lyon
- Milan
- [Zurich](https://zurich.kubetrain.io/)

The trip from Zurich is already "operational," while arrangements for the other cities are still in progress.

I encourage you to follow their website for updates and to potentially book your departure from your preferred city.

**I find this initiative incredibly interesting, kudos to the organizers!!**
