As you probably know, CyberArk hosts a major annual event called Impact, which this year took place in Boston.  
In recent weeks, CyberArk has announced an exciting initiative: the CyberArk Impact World Tour, which will be hosted in several cities around the globe.  

If you’re interested, you can find all the details [on this page](https://www.cyberark.com/impact-world-tour/), including:  

   - Cities involved
   - Agenda
   - Registration form

Personally, I’ll be attending the event in Milan, scheduled for October 11th, 2022.  
I’m excited for the opportunity to attend some fascinating sessions and meet interesting people in person. See you there!
