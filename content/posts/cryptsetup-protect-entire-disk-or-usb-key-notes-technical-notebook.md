I have been using an encrypted USB drive for several years, which unlocks with biometric access.  
Recently, I started wondering how to achieve the same level of protection with other disks or USB keys.

The answer is cryptsetup, a utility included in most Linux distributions.  
I’ve done some tests and documented how to use it in a [repository I’ve named technical_notebook](https://github.com/matteobisi/technical_notebook).

I’ll use technical_notebook as a personal notebook—it will contain commands, concepts, and useful links.  
The purpose of the repo is to help me remember these details, keep them easily accessible, and perhaps assist others who have similar needs.
