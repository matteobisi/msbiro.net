description: "The OpenSSF Open Source Project Security Baseline is a new initiative providing a structured set of security checks across three levels that open-source projects can implement to demonstrate a strong security posture. This practical framework helps maintainers improve software security and certification, fostering safer open-source ecosystems. Learn about the baseline, its levels, and how to get involved."

Today, I want to share with you a new initiative by OpenSSF called the Open Source Project Security Baseline.

![openssf logo](openssf_logo.jpg)


The TL;DR: This initiative consists of a series of checks that project maintainers must have in place in their software repositories to demonstrate a strong security posture.

The baseline is divided into three well defined levels. I find this to be an interesting and practical initiative, easy to apply for improving and certifying a project's security level.

The initiative was announced [here](https://openssf.org/press-release/2025/02/25/openssf-announces-initial-release-of-the-open-source-project-security-baseline/), and you can find the official website for this exciting new project [here](https://baseline.openssf.org/)!
