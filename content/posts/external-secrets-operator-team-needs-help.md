[External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) is a great FOSS project that, over the last few years, has gained traction in Kubernetes environments, becoming one of the standard security tools for managing and integrating Kubernetes secrets from external sources.

ESO is an operator and can be installed in different ways, for example via HELM or the OpenShift Operator Catalog. Here’s their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets).

A couple of weeks ago, the team **raised a giant RED FLAG** with the following announcement:
> We've decided to stop releases until more long-term maintainers join our team.

Unfortunately, this kind of situation is not new in FOSS and can happen for several valid reasons.
I invite you to [read this discussion](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/5084) to better understand the context.

Fortunately, the community's response has been positive, and the team has already expressed gratitude for the support received ❤️!
