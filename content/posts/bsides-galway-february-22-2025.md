It’s been a couple of years since I moved to Galway, and I’m still absolutely thrilled with my decision!

Over the past few months, I’ve had the chance to meet some awesome people at a local security meetup called [BurbSec](https://x.com/burbsecgalway). It was a fantastic experience—sharing ideas, meeting new faces, and of course, enjoying a few beers! ;-)  

Now, some of these folks are organizing a security conference called BSIDES Galway, happening on February 22nd, 2025!

The event will be held at the University of Galway and marks the very first local edition of the globally renowned BSIDES format, which takes place in cities all over the world.
The goal? To create a welcoming space where people can dive into fascinating sessions, exchange ideas, and have a blast—all while focusing on cybersecurity.

If you’re excited about joining, make sure to check out the official event website!
Right now, the Call for Papers (CFP) is open, and there are still opportunities for sponsorship.

Just a couple of days ago, the organizers released the first batch of early-bird tickets, and they SOLD OUT within hours!
So if you’re interested in attending, submitting a talk, or becoming a sponsor, head over to the website for all the details.  

**I can’t wait to see some of you there!**
