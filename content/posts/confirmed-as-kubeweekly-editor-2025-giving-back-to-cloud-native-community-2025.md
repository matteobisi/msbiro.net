One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.   
If you ever find yourself with ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù to do at work (yes, that‚Äôs ironic!), there‚Äôs always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.

Contributing back to the community you‚Äôre part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude. **After all, how could anyone be luckier than to give back to something they love?** üòä

For 2025, one of my ongoing community roles will be serving as a KubeWeekly editor‚Äîfor the second consecutive year!

For those unfamiliar, KubeWeekly is a fantastic mailing list that curates the latest news, trends, and updates in the cloud-native ecosystem. If you work in this space, I highly recommend subscribing so you don‚Äôt miss out!
