Hello there! As I mentioned before, [I’ve always been](/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/) a community person, and I’ve found a new way to contribute:   
during the first half of 2024, I’ll be one of the editors helping to curate content for KubeWeekly.

KubeWeekly is a newsletter that delivers a curated selection of news, tweets, articles, and videos about Kubernetes and the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) straight to your inbox.

If you’d like to see what we’re working on or join the mailing list, [please check out this page](https://www.cncf.io/kubeweekly/)!
