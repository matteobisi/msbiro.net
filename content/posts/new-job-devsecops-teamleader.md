Hello there! How are you?  

I’m really good! As you may have seen [on my social media](https://it.linkedin.com/in/matteobisi/), starting from the 16th of May, I’ve begun a new position as Senior DevSecOps at [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io).  
I’m really excited about this new opportunity, and I’m writing this post because it will also have an effect on this blog’s focus.  

The topics will shift from previous subjects to cloud-native infrastructure security, starting with tools like [CyberArk Conjur](https://www.cyberark.com/products/secrets-manager-enterprise/). 
The previous content on this blog will remain here forever. I believe it could be helpful for some time, and I also want to honor my HCL Ambassador role. 

I’d also love to add that my current role as organizer of the [LetsConnect](https://letsconnect.world/) user group will remain unchanged.  

I hope to see you all again at our next event!
