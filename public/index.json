The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

If you’re involved in the cloud native world as a client, developer, consultant, or major vendor you can’t miss it!\nColleagues, clients, partners, competitors, maintainers of small projects, volunteer committees, and big corporations—they’re all there!\nIt’s a unique opportunity to meet people, talk, engage, and build relationships.\nOften, just listening to other attendees discuss their challenges and needs can open your eyes to new scenarios you hadn’t considered.\nIf you’re in consulting or a client, you’ll likely meet vendors you work with throughout the year in the showcase area.\nIt’s a great chance to connect with technicians, sales representatives, or executives who will remember you or your company long after the event.\nAnd of course, the inevitable swag—t-shirts, socks, stickers—can be a pleasant bonus! Education\nOf course, a conference mainly means sessions!\nYou have the chance to hear some of the most authoritative voices discuss the topics you work with, whether business or technical sessions.\nDon’t underestimate the opportunity to ask questions during the Q\u0026A or to chat with the speaker afterwards.\nCommunity KubeCon means community. Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

If you’re involved in the cloud native world as a client, developer, consultant, or major vendor you can’t miss it!\nColleagues, clients, partners, competitors, maintainers of small projects, volunteer committees, and big corporations—they’re all there!\nIt’s a unique opportunity to meet people, talk, engage, and build relationships.\nOften, just listening to other attendees discuss their challenges and needs can open your eyes to new scenarios you hadn’t considered.\nIf you’re in consulting or a client, you’ll likely meet vendors you work with throughout the year in the showcase area.\nIt’s a great chance to connect with technicians, sales representatives, or executives who will remember you or your company long after the event.\nAnd of course, the inevitable swag like t-shirts, socks or stickers, can be a pleasant bonus!\nEducation Of course, a conference mainly means sessions!\nYou have the chance to hear some of the most authoritative voices discuss the topics you work with, whether business or technical sessions.\nDon’t underestimate the opportunity to ask questions during the Q\u0026A or to chat with the speaker afterwards.\nCommunity KubeCon means community. Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach.

It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

If you’re interested, please contact one of the organizers or reach out to me, and I’ll put you in touch with them.\nKCDs are community-organized events supported by the CNCF.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kcd-italy-2024-bologna/","tags":["kcd","italy","community","events"],"title":"KCD 2024 Italy Announced – Bologna, 20 June 2024"},{"content":"A couple of weeks ago, CyberArk released a new and interesting version of Conjur: 13.1.\nThis point release is really interesting because it brings important under-the-hood updates that aim to increase the resiliency of followers.\nIf you want to read more about this release, please check out the article I wrote on the SIGHUP blog.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-131-released/","tags":["cyberark","conjur","13.1"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur 13.1 Released"},{"content":"Yesterday, KubeCon NA in Chicago came to a close, so now we can start looking forward to KubeCon EU 2024,\nwhich will take place in Paris from March 19th to 22nd, 2024 😊.\nFor Paris, early bird registrations are open until November 28th, and it’s still possible to submit proposals for the call for papers.\nI wanted to share an interesting initiative called Kubetrain, which aims to help attendees reach Paris in a more environmentally sustainable way by choosing trains over planes.\nTo make the journey economically sustainable as well, the organizers of Kubetrain have arranged for sponsored carriages from several major European cities.\nThis innovative approach not only reduces carbon footprints but also provides opportunities for networking events during the trip!\nThe cities involved are as follows:\nAmsterdam Berlin London Lyon Milan Zurich The trip from Zurich is already “operational,” while arrangements for the other cities are still in progress.\nI encourage you to follow their website for updates and to potentially book your departure from your preferred city.\nI find this initiative incredibly interesting, kudos to the organizers!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubecon-eu-2024-paris-kubetrain/","tags":["kubecon","kubetrain"],"title":"KubeCon EU 2024 Paris – Exploring the Kubetrain Initiative"},{"content":"I’ll start with a premise for those who may not already be familiar: the open-source software ecosystem often revolves around foundations, with the most famous probably being the Linux Foundation.\nIn the cloud-native domain, the reference foundation is the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, commonly known as CNCF.\nCNCF is a foundation created by the Linux Foundation in 2015, specifically to manage projects in the cloud-native domain. In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

If you’re involved in the cloud native world as a client, developer, consultant, or major vendor you can’t miss it!\nColleagues, clients, partners, competitors, maintainers of small projects, volunteer committees, and big corporations—they’re all there!\nIt’s a unique opportunity to meet people, talk, engage, and build relationships.\nOften, just listening to other attendees discuss their challenges and needs can open your eyes to new scenarios you hadn’t considered.\nIf you’re in consulting or a client, you’ll likely meet vendors you work with throughout the year in the showcase area.\nIt’s a great chance to connect with technicians, sales representatives, or executives who will remember you or your company long after the event.\nAnd of course, the inevitable swag like t-shirts, socks or stickers, can be a pleasant bonus!\nEducation Of course, a conference mainly means sessions!\nYou have the chance to hear some of the most authoritative voices discuss the topics you work with, whether business or technical sessions.\nDon’t underestimate the opportunity to ask questions during the Q\u0026A or to chat with the speaker afterwards.\nCommunity KubeCon means community. Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

If you’re involved in the cloud native world as a client, developer, consultant, or major vendor you can’t miss it!\nColleagues, clients, partners, competitors, maintainers of small projects, volunteer committees, and big corporations—they’re all there!\nIt’s a unique opportunity to meet people, talk, engage, and build relationships.\nOften, just listening to other attendees discuss their challenges and needs can open your eyes to new scenarios you hadn’t considered.\nIf you’re in consulting or a client, you’ll likely meet vendors you work with throughout the year in the showcase area.\nIt’s a great chance to connect with technicians, sales representatives, or executives who will remember you or your company long after the event.\nAnd of course, the inevitable swag like t-shirts, socks or stickers, can be a pleasant bonus!\nEducation Of course, a conference mainly means sessions!\nYou have the chance to hear some of the most authoritative voices discuss the topics you work with, whether business or technical sessions.\nDon’t underestimate the opportunity to ask questions during the Q\u0026A or to chat with the speaker afterwards.\nCommunity KubeCon means community. Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Let’s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.\nWhat better opportunity to meet—and put a face to—the people you chat with all year on Slack?\nImmersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.\nIt allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible 😅), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!\nResources Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldn’t follow all the sessions you were interested in—or maybe you discovered some on social media!\nThe CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!\nYou can find everything in the conference agenda. The videos are available on the CNCF’s YouTube channel, and there’s a photo album with over 5,000 photos to browse! Are you already looking forward to planning your next conference?\nYou can find CNCF-sponsored conferences on this page.\nI’ll be at KCD Italy in June in Bologna, will you?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubecon-eu-2024-why-attending-a-conference-is-important/","tags":["kubecon","community","events"],"title":"KubeCon 2024: Why Attending a Conference Is Important and Some Useful Resources"},{"content":"One week ago, CyberArk released another update for Conjur Enterprise, which has now reached version 13.2—definitely another step in the right direction!\nThis release includes the usual bug fixes, expands Conjur’s integrations (for example, OpenShift 4.14 is now supported), and, most importantly, adds two exciting new features:\nCyberArk Vault Synchronizer high availability support Enhanced Conjur support for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver Synchronizer high availability enhances Conjur’s disaster recovery (DR) strategy.\nIt is now possible to set up a “passive” Synchronizer in a DR site that is aware of the status of the primary Synchronizer and can take over in case of a failure.\nThis feature allows for optimized resource usage and more effective DR strategies for customers.\nThe enhanced support for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver enables Conjur to inject secrets directly into the correct pod, bypassing the need for a sidecar or init container. This new feature helps customers optimize resource usage on their clusters while continuing to fetch secrets securely.\nCyberArk Conjur is constantly evolving with each release, and in my opinion,\nits progress over the past year has been terrific.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

A colleague was able to fix the problem there.\nThanks to CyberArk support for providing us with the openssl command, which is easy to run from the container or any server. We had tried other verification methods, but openssl s_client is readily available on most containers and servers.\nFor more information about openssl s_client and its options, check out this helpful blog post.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/troubleshooting-conjur-follower-setup-postgres-connectivity/","tags":["conjur","follower","postgres","troubleshooting"],"title":"Troubleshooting CyberArk Conjur Follower Setup and Postgres Connectivity"},{"content":"As you may know, one of the key components of the CyberArk Conjur architecture is the Synchronizer, which is required to receive secrets from the Vault.\nLast week, I took charge of an abandoned Synchronizer version 11.7 that had not been working for some time and also needed to be upgraded to the latest 12.7 release.\nAfter completing the upgrade (check this link for the steps), the Windows service failed to start, and the log contained the following error:\n[5] [main] FATAL VaultConjurSynchronizer.Service.SynchronizerService - VCSS006F Failed to start CyberArk Vault-Conjur Synchronizer Service: CASVM035E Vault name is missing.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Conjur Cloud features an impressive UI that allows users to configure and manage most settings seamlessly.\nLike Conjur Enterprise, it also has its own dedicated CLI, available for download on the CyberArk Marketplace. After installing the Conjur Cloud CLI on macOS 15.2, I encountered the following error when attempting to execute it:\nconjur -version zsh: operation not permitted: ./conjur After some troubleshooting, I discovered that the binary had been quarantined by macOS 15.2.

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

A colleague was able to fix the problem there.\nThanks to CyberArk support for providing us with the openssl command, which is easy to run from the container or any server.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation Each pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host—even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention By isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk User namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”—it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation Each pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host—even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention By isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk User namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”—it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host—even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”—it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts.

Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host, even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”—it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings. It’s important to always adhere to the code of conduct when participating and contributing.\nIn this case as well, I’ll provide you with some useful links where you can find collaboration ideas for OpenSSF:\nOpenSSF Working Groups Get Involved OpenSSF repositories on GitHub OpenSSF Slack ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-value-of-community-contributions-exploring-cncf-openssf/","tags":["community","cncf","openssf","contribution"],"title":"The Value of Community Contributions: Exploring CNCF and OpenSSF"},{"content":"During the previous days, CyberArk has released version 13.0 of Conjur Enterprise.\nWhat’s new?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host, even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”—it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

Conjur Cloud features an impressive UI that allows users to configure and manage most settings seamlessly.\nLike Conjur Enterprise, it also has its own dedicated CLI, available for download on the CyberArk Marketplace. After installing the Conjur Cloud CLI on macOS 15.2, I encountered the following error when attempting to execute it:\nconjur -version zsh: operation not permitted: ./conjur After some troubleshooting, I discovered that the binary had been quarantined by macOS 15.2.

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host, even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”, it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host, even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”, it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF. This foundation is an initiative of the Linux Foundation and focuses on enhancing the security of open-source software.\nSince I work in security, I closely follow various initiatives of this foundation.\nAt the moment, due to time constraints, I’m not an active contributor, but members of my team have already had the opportunity to contribute and participate in various working group meetings.

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS).

Be sure to check out the release notes; I assure you, you won’t be disappointed!\nAs the Team Leader of a DevSecOps group, I tend to focus on security features. In this article, I want to highlight the new pod support for user namespaces.\nThis feature isn’t entirely new—it was first introduced as an Alpha feature (UserNamespacesSupport) in Kubernetes 1.28. However, as of version 1.33, it is enabled by default, and there’s no longer any need to set a Kubernetes feature flag.\nThis means the feature is now much easier to use, and you should definitely consider enabling it for your pods as well.\nWhy Is This So Important? This capability relies on a Linux kernel feature that enables pods to use “user namespaces.” A pod is essentially a process (or a group of processes) running on a Kubernetes worker node, utilizing its CPU, memory, and storage.\nWith user namespaces, Kubernetes can remap the UID and GID of the pod within its own namespace, ensuring that it runs as an unprivileged user on the host. This greatly enhances the security of your workloads.\nThis is how the user namespace influences the UID remapping of the pods:\nHost UID/GID Range Usage Container UID/GID Mapping 0 – 65535 Reserved for host N/A 65536 – 131071 Pod 1 0 – 65535 (in container) 131072 – 196607 Pod 2 0 – 65535 (in container) 196608 – 262143 Pod 3 0 – 65535 (in container) … … … Root inside Pod 1 (UID 0) → Host UID 65536 Root inside Pod 2 (UID 0) → Host UID 131072 The Benefits of Enabling User Namespaces for Pods Process Isolation\nEach pod runs with a unique, unprivileged UID/GID range on the host, even if the container operates as root internally. This ensures that containerized processes cannot inadvertently (or maliciously) access host resources or other pods. For example, a root user inside the container maps to a non-root UID on the host, as described in Kubernetes’ default user namespace implementation.\nLateral Movement Prevention\nBy isolating UID/GID ranges per pod, a compromised container faces significant barriers to attacking adjacent pods or the host. Even if an escape occurs, the attacker inherits the pod’s unprivileged host identity, limiting access to files, processes, or network resources outside its namespace.\nEnhanced Functionality Without Host Risk\nUser namespaces allow containers to safely use privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN for FUSE mounts) without exposing the host. This is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where build containers often require elevated privileges but shouldn’t endanger the underlying node.\nHow to Enable User Namespaces Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, user namespaces are enabled by default for pods that opt in via hostUsers: false in the pod spec.\nHere’s a minimal example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secured-pod spec: hostUsers: false # Enables user namespace isolation containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest Is User Namespace “Free” in Kubernetes 1.33? While Kubernetes 1.33 enables user namespaces by default, adopting this feature isn’t entirely “free”, it requires specific infrastructure and runtime prerequisites. Below are the key requirements to ensure compatibility:\nPrerequisites Kubernetes Cluster\nv1.33+: User namespaces are enabled by default. v1.28–1.32: Requires enabling the UserNamespacesSupport feature gate. Worker Node Requirements\nLinux Kernel ≥ 6.3: Mandatory for idmap mounts support. Container Runtimes\ncontainerd ≥ 2.0 or CRI-O ≥ 1.25 runc ≥ 1.2 or crun ≥ 1.9 (recommended: crun ≥ 1.13) Storage File Systems The file system used for /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ must support idmap mounts. Compatible options include:\nFile System Notes ext4 Widely supported xfs Requires ftype=1 tmpfs Suitable for ephemeral storage overlayfs Default for container layers Why These Requirements Matter Idmap Mounts: Ensure file ownership mappings between container and host users work seamlessly. Without this, volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) may fail to mount correctly. Runtime Compatibility: Older runtimes like cri-dockerd lack user namespace support, necessitating upgrades to containerd or CRI-O. Security Impact: A Nice Improvement! User namespaces mitigate critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0492 (container escape via cgroups). By mapping container root to unprivileged host UIDs, even compromised pods cannot escalate privileges on the host.\nFor a hands-on demonstration, watch this video showing how user namespaces block container breakouts.\nFor deeper insights, refer to the Kubernetes documentation or this blog post .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kubernetes-133-user-namespace-isolation-security-matters/","tags":["kubernetes","hostUsers","security","isolation"],"title":"Securing Kubernetes 1.33 Pods: The Impact of User Namespace Isolation and hostUsers: false"},{"content":"Starting with version 12, Grafana introduces the ability to configure dashboards using a GitOps approach through an experimental feature called Git Sync.\nThis is a particularly interesting capability that can help manage dashboards in large and complex environments.\nGit Sync is available as an experimental feature in both Grafana OSS and Enterprise editions.

There were no errors; it just hung during startup.\nAfter performing all the necessary checks and finding no logs, I tried the usual troubleshooting steps, including cleaning up and reinstalling. This resolved the issue and revealed the cause: my MacBook previously had an older version of Podman installed, which I had completely forgotten about.\nFollowing the new installation of Podman Desktop, since no existing version was detected, the setup prompted me to install a newer version. At this point, the setup for Podman Desktop identified that the existing Podman machine was incompatible with the current release.\nAfter confirming the removal of the unsupported Podman machine and proceeding with its recreation, the Podman machine started successfully.\nKey Takeaway: When using Podman Desktop on macOS, especially after previous installations or upgrades, ensure that the Podman machine is compatible with your current Podman version. If you encounter startup issues, check for legacy Podman installations or machines that may cause version conflicts. Removing and recreating the Podman machine often resolves these compatibility problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/podman-desktop-and-podman-machine-on-macos-pay-attention-to-podman-version/","tags":["podman","podman desktop","podman machine"],"title":"macOS, Podman Desktop and the Podman Machine: Pay Close Attention to the Podman Version"},{"content":"One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.\nIf you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.\nContributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude.

In simple terms, it can be defined as a third-party, vendor-neutral entity that oversees the development and activities related to major projects involving containerized technologies like Kubernetes.\nThe foundation consists of a large number of sub-entities and working groups that oversee various projects, and much of the work is done by volunteers. To participate, everyone must adhere to the CNCF’s code of conduct.\nWhen considering Kubernetes and the main projects associated with it, you can imagine the amount of work required to keep this system running and how many people—at all levels—are needed to contribute, both technically and non-technically.\nThroughout my career, I have always tried to be involved in the community surrounding my professional world—participating in events, speaking at them, and even organizing some myself.\nEven in my current role at SIGHUP, I have maintained the same approach. For the past few months, I have been part of the Italian team responsible for the Italian localization of the CNCF’s glossary.\nI share this with you because I find it extremely rewarding to participate in these kinds of initiatives. It’s a great way to meet new people, step a bit outside your comfort zone, and assist others—including people and companies you may not know—all for the sake of fostering a better ecosystem.\nAs you can imagine, contributions can be made at all levels, with different teams dedicated to different scopes. Of course, it’s common to work with people from all around the world and from diverse backgrounds.\nAs a colleague told me recently, “If you enter a meeting and feel like a fool compared to the other participants, it probably means you’re in the right place.” Participating in meetings—even as an observer—with high-level individuals is a great opportunity for professional growth.\nNow that I’ve piqued your interest, how can you participate or find a project that suits you?\nI suggest exploring the following links for information about CNCF events and projects:\nExplore all CNCF sites End User Community CNCF Slack CNCF repositories on GitHub What I’ve mentioned above also applies to another very interesting foundation, born in 2020, called the Open Source Security Foundation, commonly abbreviated as OpenSSF.

The availability of countless open-source libraries and containers has accelerated development, but how can we be sure that all these resources are secure?\nHow can developers be responsible for the security of their own code as well as the work of others? How can security officers manage this scenario without becoming a bottleneck to productivity?\nSnyk helps by integrating its tools into IDEs, Git repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, providing fast analysis and suggesting solutions for detected issues.\nFor example, Snyk can be installed as a VSCode plugin or set up to scan Git repositories. If an issue is found, it can automatically open a pull request proposing a fix.\nSnyk is also fully integrable into customer environments, supporting both access and security policies to ensure full compliance with customer needs. Customizable dashboards and reports are available, enabling security officers to quickly understand the security status of a project.\nAnother interesting feature is that Snyk has built an open-source vulnerability database that catalogs vulnerabilities and provides examples and tutorials for developers.\nThe best part is that testing Snyk is easy—a free (limited) plan is available!\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Snyk, please read the blog article published by my colleague Luca Bandini about our experience with Snyk,\nwhich we also used to check the code of Fury, the Kubernetes distribution developed by SIGHUP.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-make-developers-and-security-officers-happy-with-snyk/","tags":["snyk","sast","sca","supply-chain"],"title":"How Is It Possible to Make Both Developers and Security Officers Happy?

Authentication for both users and hosts is based on an ID and API key. authn-oidc Leverages the identity layer provided by OIDC to allow applications to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets needed for connecting to services such as a database. authn-iam Enables an AWS resource to use its AWS IAM role to authenticate with Conjur. authn-azure Enables an Azure resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-jwt Enables an application to authenticate to Conjur using a JWT from a JWT Provider. authn-gcp Enables a Google Cloud Platform resource to authenticate with Conjur authn-k8s Authenticates hosts that are Kubernetes resources, such as a Kubernetes namespace, deployment, stateful set, and others. Authentication is certificate-based using a mutual TLS connection. authn-ldap Authenticates users based on an LDAP directory. By default, after the initial setup, authn is the only authenticator enabled, and it is responsible for Conjur access using a username or API key (randomly generated between 51 and 56 characters).\nWhen integrations are needed, for example with a Kubernetes cluster, you need to activate and configure the authn-k8s authenticator. This authenticator can establish a secure mTLS connection compliant with the SPIFFE framework, as described in the following diagram (click here for more details).\nIf you need integrations with cloud identities that support JWT authentication, such as Google Apigee, you will enable the authn-jwt authenticator, which will perform the integrations as shown below:\nThese were just two examples among the many possible secure integrations enabled by the authenticators. The following is a more complete list:\nKubernetes (local or cloud) API gateway Jenkins Ansible Puppet Terraform Cloud services If the scenario described sounds interesting for your needs, Conjur could definitely be the right choice.

PostgreSQL database: Two databases, one for configurations and secrets, and one for audit logs. Conjur appliance: The core product. syslog-ng: Used to collect audit and access logs. The smallest common configuration for Conjur Enterprise is a three-node cluster with auto-failover, as shown in the following diagram:\nThe cluster architecture follows an active-passive model, with high availability guaranteed by a load balancer placed in front of the cluster. This load balancer switches the node accessed by applications in case of a failure.\nWithin the cluster, one node acts as the “leader node,” handling all read/write operations and providing the API for applications to interact with secrets.\nThe secondary nodes are called “standbys” and can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the PostgreSQL replication setup.\nThese nodes are inactive and do not provide API services.\nIf the leader node fails, after a configurable period, the standbys will elect a new leader using etcd and the Raft consensus algorithm.\nIf auto-failover is not configured, manual promotion is required.\nIt is also possible to configure a primary site with auto-failover and a secondary site with asynchronous standbys (without auto-failover), ready to be promoted manually.\nThe final component of the architecture is the “follower,” a read-only replica of the leader. Followers allow secrets to be read at scale and are horizontally scalable components typically configured behind a load balancer to handle all types of read requests, including authentication, permission checks, and secret fetches.\nFollowers are usually installed on a Kubernetes cluster to serve applications with low latency.\nThe architecture diagram with followers could be expanded as shown below:\nSystem Requirements Production environment:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM 50 GB hard drive Test environment:\n2 cores 4 GB RAM 20 GB hard drive Supported container runtimes:\nDocker 1.13 or later Mirantis Container Runtime (MRC) 19.x, 20.10 on RHEL 8.x Kubernetes and OpenShift (only for the follower) Podman 3.3 and 3.4 The host server should run an operating system supported by the container runtime (the most popular are RHEL Server, RHEL-based, or Ubuntu Server LTS). To read more detail or updated versions please refer to this page.\nIf the customer environment also includes a CyberArk Vault server that needs to be synchronized with Conjur, the following are the requirements for a CyberArk Vault Synchronizer server:\n4 cores 8 GB RAM Windows Server 2012 R2 or later ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cyberark-conjur-architecture-system-requirements/","tags":["conjur","cyberark","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur: A Quick Overview of Architecture and System Requirements"},{"content":"Security is always a complex topic to address, as an error or omission in processes can lead to serious economic or reputational damage for a company.\nWhen we talk about “secrets,” consider the following examples:\nUsernames Database passwords SSL certificates and keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Simply reading through this list helps to explain why this topic needs to be considered and handled carefully.\nSome common bad practices or risks include:\nHardcoding secrets in code Data breaches Password leaks Secrets pushed to public repositories With practices like lateral movement, just one compromised secret can be enough to compromise an entire environment. To help prevent these risks, there are tools known as “enterprise secrets managers.” I’d like to start a series of posts on this blog about CyberArk Conjur.\nConjur allows you to avoid direct use of secrets by leveraging a set of REST APIs, making it a programmable tool that can be accessed via URL or open source utilities.\nSecurity is enforced through security policies without slowing down the developers involved.\nCorporate security can be further improved with the use of rotators, which programmatically change secret values.\nIf other CyberArk software like PAS Vault is already in use, Conjur can be integrated using the Synchroniser component,\nproviding the same level of security for cloud-native infrastructure.\nConjur is available in two versions: enterprise and open source, each with distinct features.\nIn upcoming posts, I will explain details about the architecture, secrets management, and product news related to CyberArk Conjur.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-you-need-kubernetes-secrets-manager/","tags":["conjur","introduction","secrets manager"],"title":"CyberArk Conjur - why you (probably) need an enterprise secrets manager"},{"content":"Hello there!
