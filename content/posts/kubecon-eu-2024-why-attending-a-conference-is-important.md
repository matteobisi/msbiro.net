Last week, I had the pleasure of attending KubeCon 2024 EU in Paris. 
I must begin by **thanking [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io/)** for giving me the opportunity to participate in my second consecutive KubeCon, **THANK YOU!**

I decided to write this post to encourage those who have never attended a large-scale event to give it a try!  

## In this case, size matters!

If youâ€™re involved in the cloud native world as a client, developer, consultant, or major vendor you canâ€™t miss it!   
Colleagues, clients, partners, competitors, maintainers of small projects, volunteer committees, and big corporationsâ€”theyâ€™re all there!

Itâ€™s a unique opportunity to meet people, talk, engage, and build relationships.

Often, just listening to other attendees discuss their challenges and needs can open your eyes to new scenarios you hadnâ€™t considered.  
If youâ€™re in consulting or a client, youâ€™ll likely meet vendors you work with throughout the year in the showcase area.   
Itâ€™s a great chance to connect with technicians, sales representatives, or executives who will remember you or your company long after the event.  

And of course, the inevitable swag like t-shirts, socks or stickers, can be a pleasant bonus!

## Education

**Of course, a conference mainly means sessions!**

You have the chance to hear some of the most authoritative voices discuss the topics you work with, whether business or technical sessions.  
Donâ€™t underestimate the opportunity to ask questions during the Q&A or to chat with the speaker afterwards.

## Community

KubeCon means community. Letâ€™s not forget that CNCF projects are built on the open-source community, which you can collaborate with on many levels.  
What better opportunity to meetâ€”and put a face toâ€”the people you chat with all year on Slack?

Immersing yourself in the community is a unique opportunity, especially at the end of the first quarter.   
It allows you to pause your projects (as much as possible ðŸ˜…), recharge your batteries, and come back energized and motivated!

## Resources

Whether you attended or not, you certainly couldnâ€™t follow all the sessions you were interested inâ€”or maybe you discovered some on social media!   
The CNCF records all sessions and provides videos and presentations, almost in real time. Wow!

You can find everything in the [conference agenda](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/?iframe=no). The videos are available on the [CNCFâ€™s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cncf/videos), and thereâ€™s a [photo album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/143247548@N03/albums/72177720315561784/) with over 5,000 photos to browse!
Are you already looking forward to planning your next conference?

You can find CNCF-sponsored conferences on this page.   

**Iâ€™ll be at KCD Italy in June in Bologna, will you?**
