A few months ago, I shared the news about [joining the Cloud Native Days Italy organizing team](/posts/cloud-native-days-team-news/), and I wanted to give you an update on how things are progressing as we approach the big event in May 2026.

## The Organizing Journey: Hard Work, Big Rewards

Working on Cloud Native Days Italy after my regular job is no small task. Between planning sessions, coordinating with team members, and handling the countless details that go into organizing a major tech conference, the hours add up quickly. But I have to say: **it's incredibly rewarding**.

Seeing the progress we're making as a team, watching the event take shape week by week, and knowing that we're building something meaningful for the Italian cloud-native community keeps me motivated. The team is fantastic to work with, and everyone brings their unique skills and passion to the table.

## What's Happening Now: Sponsors, Submissions, and Tickets

### Hunting Sponsors

One of my current main focuses is **sponsor outreach**. We've put together a comprehensive [sponsorship prospectus](https://cloudnativedaysitaly.org/prospectus/cloudnativedays-italy-2026-sponsorship-prospectus.pdf) that outlines the value and opportunities for companies looking to connect with the cloud-native community in Italy.

If your company is interested in supporting Cloud Native Days Italy 2026, or if you know someone who might be, please check out the prospectus and reach out to us. Sponsors make events like this possible, and we're committed to creating meaningful partnerships that benefit everyone involved.

### Call for Proposals: Thank You!

I'm thrilled to report that we're receiving **a lot of submissions** through our [Sessionize CFP page](https://sessionize.com/cloud-native-days-italy-2026). The quality and diversity of topics are outstanding, and it's energizing to see so much interest from speakers across Italy and beyond.

**Thank you** to everyone who has submitted a proposal! Your enthusiasm and willingness to share your knowledge with the community is what makes events like Cloud Native Days truly special.

### Ticket Sales: Coming Soon!

Here's what everyone has been waiting for: **ticket sales will start very soon!** We're finalizing the last details, and we'll be ready to open registration in the coming weeks.

To make sure you don't miss the announcement and to get access to **exclusive discount codes**, I highly recommend joining our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/cloudnativedaysitaly). We'll be sharing updates, behind-the-scenes content, and special offers for our community there.
