Yesterday, the organizers of [KCD Italy announced](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudnativedaysitaly/posts/?feedView=all) that the conference will return in 2025, once again in Bologna, in June!

For various organizational reasons, the conference will be rebranded as Cloud Native Days Italy, **but the quality will remain just as high.**

At the moment, no further details are available. Start marking your calendarâ€”see you in Bologna!
