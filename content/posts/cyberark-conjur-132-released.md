One week ago, CyberArk released another update for Conjur Enterprise, which has now reached version 13.2—definitely another step in the right direction!  

This release includes the usual bug fixes, expands Conjur’s integrations (for example, OpenShift 4.14 is now supported), and, most importantly, adds two exciting new features:

- CyberArk Vault Synchronizer high availability support
- Enhanced Conjur support for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver

Synchronizer high availability enhances Conjur’s disaster recovery (DR) strategy.  
It is now possible to set up a "passive" Synchronizer in a DR site that is aware of the status of the primary Synchronizer and can take over in case of a failure.

This feature allows for optimized resource usage and more effective DR strategies for customers.  

The enhanced support for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver enables Conjur to inject secrets directly into the correct pod, bypassing the need for a sidecar or init container.
This new feature helps customers optimize resource usage on their clusters while continuing to fetch secrets securely.  

CyberArk Conjur is constantly evolving with each release, and in my opinion,  
its progress over the past year has been terrific. **Big kudos to CyberArk!**

As a final reminder, CyberArk Conjur is a secrets manager available in three different versions:

- [Enterprise](https://www.cyberark.com/products/secrets-manager-enterprise/)
- [Open Source](https://www.conjur.org/)
- [Cloud](https://docs.cyberark.com/conjur-cloud/latest/en/Content/ConjurCloud/cl_ConjurCloudOverview.htm?tocpath=Get%20started%7C_____1)
