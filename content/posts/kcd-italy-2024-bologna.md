Hello there! Just a quick post to share that [KCD Italy](https://kcd.pizza/) has been announced and will take place in Bologna on 20 June 2024!  

![kcd call for paper](kcd-cfp.jpeg)

I’m not directly involved in organizing this event, [but my company is](https://www.sighup.io/), so I’m publishing this post to help spread the word!

The CFP (Call for Proposals) is open and available at this link. English sessions are welcome!  
We are also still looking for new sponsors. If you’re interested, please contact one of the organizers or reach out to me, and I’ll put you in touch with them.  

KCDs are community-organized events [supported by the CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/kcds/).
