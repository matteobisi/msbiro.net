Quick but exciting personal update: I am now part of the organizing team for the [Cloud Native Days](https://cloudnativedaysitaly.org/) event in Italy!

![Cloud Native Days Italy](cloud-native-days-logo.webp#center)

Everyone who knows me understands how much I love the community side of my work and how passionate I am about joining events and organizing amazing experiences. Having worked on event organization before with my friends at [Let's Connect](https://www.letsconnect.world), I know it’s both challenging and incredibly rewarding.

Events like this naturally see some turnover each year, so I’ll be one of the new faces at the 2026 event in Bologna. Although I’ve lived in Ireland for over 2.5 years, Italy remains the focus of my professional environment, so this role makes perfect sense for me.

I’m joining [a fantastic team](https://cloudnativedaysitaly.org/team) and will do my best to make the work easier and more enjoyable for everyone involved.
