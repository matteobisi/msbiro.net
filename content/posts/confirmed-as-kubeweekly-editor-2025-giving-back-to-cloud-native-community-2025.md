One of the pleasures of working with open-source software (OSS) and community-driven initiatives is the endless opportunities they offer.   
If you ever find yourself with “not enough” to do at work (yes, that’s ironic!), there’s always an easy way to take on something extra and meaningful.

Contributing back to the community you’re part of is a wonderful way to express gratitude. **After all, how could anyone be luckier than to give back to something they love?** 😊

For 2025, one of my ongoing community roles will be serving as a KubeWeekly editor—for the second consecutive year!

For those unfamiliar, KubeWeekly is a fantastic mailing list that curates the latest news, trends, and updates in the cloud-native ecosystem. If you work in this space, I highly recommend subscribing so you don’t miss out!
