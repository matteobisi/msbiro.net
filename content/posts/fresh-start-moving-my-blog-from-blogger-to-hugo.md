I finally did it! After years of delay, I moved my blog away from Blogger. I needed something modern and better suited to my content, so I decided to go with Hugo and the PaperMod theme. The site is stored in a GitHub repository and hosted by Cloudflare Pages, which builds my site every time I push something to the repository.

I won't bore you with details about how much better this technical solution is compared to Blogger, but I'll leave you with some useful links if you're curious:

- [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation) - the wiki with installation setup I followed
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/) - how I put this blog online

In conjunction with this change, I reorganized my content as follows:

- I migrated all my English cloud-native blog posts to this new blog
- I moved my previous English blog to https://archive-en.msbiro.net
- I moved my previous Italian blog to https://archive-it.msbiro.net

I decided to keep that content online (with no plans to remove it) because some of the guides and tips are still helpful today.

From now on, I'll only blog in English.

That's everything until the next blog post, **enjoy the weekend**!
