As you may know, one of the key components of the CyberArk Conjur architecture is the [Synchronizer](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Conjur/cv_Synchronizer-lp.htm), which is required to receive secrets from the Vault.

Last week, I took charge of an abandoned Synchronizer version 11.7 that had not been working for some time and also needed to be upgraded to the latest 12.7 release.

After completing the upgrade (check [this link](https://docs.cyberark.com/conjur-enterprise/latest/en/content/conjur/cv_upgrade.htm?tocpath=Integrations%7CCyberArk%20Vault%20Synchronizer%7C_____11) for the steps), the Windows service failed to start, and the log contained the following error:

```
[5] [main] FATAL VaultConjurSynchronizer.Service.SynchronizerService - VCSS006F Failed to start CyberArk Vault-Conjur Synchronizer Service: CASVM035E Vault name is missing.
```

After searching online, we found references to the CASOS log error for the Vault, where the documentation suggests contacting CyberArk support.

Fortunately, in the case of the Synchronizer, we were able to resolve the issue easily by editing the following file:

```
C:\Program Files\CyberArk\Synchronizer\VaultConjurSynchronizer.exe.config
```

The value of the key INTEGRATION_VAULT_NAME was blank. After filling it in with the correct vault name (as specified in vault.ini), the service started successfully and secrets synchronization resumed as expected.
