Hello, I’m Matteo Bisi.

I’m a DevSecOps Team Leader currently living in Galway, Ireland, but originally from Italy.   
With a passion for both technology and teamwork, I lead my team in building and securing cloud-native infrastructures using both open source   and enterprise tools.  

My journey has taken me across different roles, giving me a unique perspective on how diverse teams collaborate and innovate.  
I’m particularly interested in automating security practices, managing secrets at scale, and empowering development teams to deliver secure software efficiently.  

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the beautiful Irish countryside, planning my next family trip, and cooking some Italian recipes.   

Through this blog, I hope to share insights, best practices, and lessons learned from my experiences leading DevSecOps teams.  
You can find more information about my CV on my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/matteobisi).
