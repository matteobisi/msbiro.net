This article is a follow-up to my [previous post](https://www.msbiro.net/posts/external-secrets-operator-team-needs-help/) about the state of the External Secrets Operator project.  
Let’s start with the most important news: **External Secrets Operator is set to resume releases on September 22!!!**

### What changed

More than 300 volunteers have signed up to contribute across organizations, far exceeding expectations and widening the pipeline of future Members, Reviewers, and Maintainers. Governance has been clarified with a formal **Contribution Ladder** and focused tracks (Core, Providers, CI, Testing), plus interim roles to spread the load and reduce burnout risk.

### What’s next

As a security professional and FOSS believer, I’m glad the situation is heading in the right direction. Once again, I want to reiterate the call for contributions: if you can help, please read [this page](https://external-secrets.io/latest/contributing/process/) to learn more about the contributing process. If you want more details about the ESO situation, please read [this issue](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/5084).
